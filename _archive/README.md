# The Graveyard 🪦

This folder contains features, scripts, and styles that have been removed from the active codebase but are preserved here in case they need to be resurrected.

## Resurrecting a Feature
1. Move the file back to its original location (e.g., `js/` or `css/`).
2. Uncomment the `<link>` or `<script>` tag in `index.html`.
3. Verify functionality.

## Buried Features
